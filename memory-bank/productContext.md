# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Traditional food delivery apps rely heavily on touch-based interactions, requiring users to:
- Navigate through multiple screens and menus
- Type search queries manually
- Click through various filters and options
- Manually add items to cart one by one

This creates friction for users who are:
- Multitasking (cooking, working, driving)
- Have accessibility needs (visual impairments, motor difficulties)
- Prefer voice interaction over typing
- Want faster, more natural ordering experiences

### The Solution
**eat-speak-easy** solves this by combining a traditional food delivery interface with ElevenLabs Conversational AI, enabling:
- **Voice Navigation**: "Take me to restaurants" or "Show me the cart"
- **Natural Language Search**: "Find me spicy Thai food under $20" 
- **Voice Ordering**: "Add two margherita pizzas to my cart"
- **Intelligent Filtering**: "Show me vegetarian restaurants open now within 2km"

## Problems It Solves

### 1. Accessibility Barriers
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Voice commands bypass complex UI navigation
- **Motor Accessibility**: Reduces need for precise clicking/tapping
- **Visual Accessibility**: Audio feedback for actions and navigation

### 2. User Experience Friction
- **Speed**: Voice commands are faster than clicking through multiple screens
- **Multitasking**: Users can order food while doing other activities
- **Discovery**: Natural language makes finding new food easier
- **Cognitive Load**: Less mental effort than remembering navigation paths

### 3. Modern Interaction Paradigms
- **Voice-First Generation**: Appeals to users comfortable with Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant
- **AI Integration**: Demonstrates practical AI applications in e-commerce
- **Conversational Commerce**: Pioneers voice-driven food ordering

## How It Should Work

### Core User Flows

#### 1. Voice-Powered Discovery
```
User: "Find me Italian restaurants with good ratings"
AI: Navigates to restaurants page with Italian filter applied
UI: Shows filtered results with ratings prominently displayed
```

#### 2. Natural Language Ordering
```
User: "Add the margherita pizza and Caesar salad to my cart"
AI: Identifies items from current restaurant menu
UI: Updates cart with visual confirmation
AI: "I've added margherita pizza and Caesar salad to your cart"
```

#### 3. Smart Navigation
```
User: "Take me to my cart"
AI: Navigates to cart page
UI: Shows cart contents with total
AI: "Here's your cart with 3 items totaling $34.97"
```

### User Experience Goals

#### Seamless Integration
- Voice commands should feel natural, not forced
- UI state should immediately reflect voice actions
- Visual feedback should confirm all voice interactions
- Users should be able to switch between voice and touch seamlessly

#### Intelligent Assistance
- AI should understand context (current page, selected restaurant)
- Provide helpful suggestions based on user behavior
- Handle ambiguity gracefully ("Which pizza did you mean?")
- Remember preferences within the session

#### Accessibility First
- All voice features should have visual equivalents
- Screen readers should work with voice integration
- Keyboard navigation should remain functional
- Clear audio feedback for all actions
